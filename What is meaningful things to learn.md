### What i THINK may be things i love       
[[Atomic Ideas/maths]]
- Learning/experiencing only, not working, this is not practical
-> Doing things require lots of learning, but sometimes work for others, which is not satisfying 
Create own Creations ? <============== BEST OPTION 
#### => Most meaningful things: Creating 
## GAME DEVELOPMENT GOT ALL I NEED <=== PERFECT CHOICE
- No prioritzing money
- Creative 
- Fucking wide range of knowledge
- Anything can be gamified, even the points below
**Except**..... Unsettled jobs, underpaid, stuck in stupid industrial games,  
Looking into indie game dev? Very viable, but not as main $ making
## => GAME as partime or ... retired job?
- Find something equally but easier to EARN 
# INTRODUCING Computer Science + FOSS 
- More industrial than indie game, but better paid 
- ANOTHER FORM OF CREATION <===== good point 
--> Transform into backend dev? 
--> buildin' teamwork, network, communication 
## But these seems ... a bit far, let's look closer
-  Implementing others' game ideas Godot ? Rust ? Unity ? C++ ?  <==== DO THIS 
- Bounty: Very good for long term knowledge pool <====== DO THIS 
-> Godot 2 reasons: 
1. I only like 2d games 
2. my lap cannot handle Unity 
3. maybe switch after I got a PC? 3D Stuffs like kingdoms and castle is actually good, not now 
- Backend API  <==== TRY THIS 
-> Big fucking problem: noone will let you handle data side if no exp, 
side effects 
- Automation tasks 
-> I wanna find something that can be put into [[MEANINGFUL Pool]]
- Smart contracts <===== TRY THIS OUT 
### Ok, i got a part time job, now what 
- Team up!!! develop network, communication 
- Things that focus on Creation, instead of Industrialiation 
- The key here is things that are [[MEANINGFUL Pool|grow]] (CS, FOSS, product-based system design backend)  
- Machine Learning ? Yes, if it's not all about tuning 
- a paid FOSS  
- see [[Areas to work]]

# Now what ? 
- chill, learn whatever comes up, no matter what fields, see youtube, sources
- want it ? learn it  
- when to do this, well, now, in free time
- creative with game or ... anything 
# Capstone 
[[What is meaningful things to learn#But these seems a bit far let's look closer|look close first]]: 60 
works up a core: 40 
1. [[What is meaningful things to learn#INTRODUCING Computer Science FOSS|Open source CS related]]
2. DSA, CS, Game Creativity related as a main [[MEANINGFUL Pool]]
3. Anything allowed in [[MEANINGFUL Pool]]
optimizing the curve: free time routine
1. reading 
2. piano/guitar
3. languages
4. additional things pick up on the way :D
