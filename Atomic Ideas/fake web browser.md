# Internet sandbox
I make a browser. 
When browsing into certain static sites, you can edit it with F12, then save it to browser. 
Whenever you got to that link again the browser gonna redirect you to the previous saved HTML instead (if the mode is on) 
It kinda fun to create a whole personalized internet (universe)


A few keypoints:   
- client browser (search bar, load html)   
- request
- google search api    
- local storage system (desktop only) 

Frontend 
- handle search or link input from user   
- load html  
- realtime IDE html css js edit  
- interface backend: modes (backend state), save-load, api call  

Backend 
- state management: which mode it in  
- save to local dir  
- load from local folder   
- api calls   
# Todo 
- api calls from backend faster than frontend ?
