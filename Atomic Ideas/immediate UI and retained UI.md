- retain UI is  traditional, we have a tree of objects (DOM,...), event listener on components. Event trigger 
UI rendering (of specific part) 
- immediate UI renders everything by frame (infinite game loop) 
-> easier to implement, no need callbacks (event handlers), just update variable and ur good to go
