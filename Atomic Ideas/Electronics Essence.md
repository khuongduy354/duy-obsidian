- consist of 2 metal plates, separate by insulator middle
- ![[Pasted image 20220828194341.png]]
- Once apply voltage, push e- to one plate, while repel e- on the other
-> causing a + and - side -> potential energy. 
- Once remove voltage, the e- in (-) side floods out, while (+) side attracts e- 
-> cause a current 
### applications 
- stabilize electricity, even when remove voltage, still can create current for short time 
C = Q / V . Farads (F) 
Q (charge) in Coulomb (C). 
-> Voltage takes to **squeeze** Q charges.
