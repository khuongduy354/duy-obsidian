flow blockers: mobile phone, reduce attention span and cheap dopmanie  
	- friction: aim for high exertion, low perceived, do more judge less 
flow proness: highest in morning, so trigger it before get blocked 
flow trigger:  clear small target, balance challenge, feedback/milestones, lower mental hurdles (generous time, simpler scope) 
	- set up time (bells) for triggers  
	- setup habit for trigger: bath then work  
	- plan day (chronotype dependent) ahead for lower cognitive load       
	-> reduce VUCA as much AP
	 
flow cycle:  
	- struggle, at start only 
	- release 
	- flow
	- recovery = thriving  
flow sustain: 
	- replenish physical = change position / workout
	- replenish mental = change places, boring break

life outside of flow: 
	- take boring break, sit quietly, observe with 5 senses     
	- be quiet, breathe   
	- focus on one thing at a time: 10-20 mins block of 1 task
	 - restrict working hours 4 a day, a few days none work in a week  


instrict motivations  
	- dont chase money or status 
	- progress > results
	- rather: mastery, liking, purpose, independence 
		- mastery: do for the sake of being good at doing it  
		- liking: do for fun  
		- purpose: do for an end result 
		- independence: do it alone, unsupervised
	- raise area you lack

 rewiring: 
	 - overriding for no reason 
	 - reduce cognitive load / junk by planning / journaling    
	 - observe certain response, quantum shift it 
	 - reduce rumination / judgement 
	 - leveraging negative effects instead of denying it
