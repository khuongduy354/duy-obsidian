# Serial
- spi: full duplex, single master slave, faster i2c 
- i2c: half duplex, multi master, multi slave, easy to add new slaves 
- UART: 
	- special, not a protocol but a circuit 
	- duplex like SPI 
	- 2-wire like i2c, low speed communication
# Serial & Ethernet   
see [[tcp ip and protocols]]
### Serial: 
- called since RS-232 
- transmit individuals bytes
### Ethernet 
- transmit packet (64-1536 bytes)
-> Serial transfer synchronously (chronological order), Ethernet asynchronously (just ensure that sender and receiver has same data)

**Notes**: 
- Ethernet is more secured,fast, reliable
- Serial is faster to setup (no network card, IP address needed )
-> also if a network has Ethernet already, we can setup another network with Serial easily, if setup another Ethernet second network card is required.
