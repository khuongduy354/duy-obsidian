	- - when sound move towards a direction, that direction bunched up  waves
- => higher frequency observe
- - when .... away a direction, .... spread out 
- => lower f  
 ### in terms of light 
- frequency in (visible) light is **color** 
- when  a star move towards, it emits bluer light (higher frequency) 
- when it move away, redder light, called redshift

### formula intuition 
1 cycle lambda got shortened, due to move closer. 
$\lambda' = \lambda - v_sT$  
- spread side: 
1 cycle lambda got lengthened, due to move further. 
$\lambda' = \lambda + v_sT$
