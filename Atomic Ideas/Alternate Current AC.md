-> e ( tương tự vận tốc ) chậm pha hơn pi/2

-> mỗi lần qua peak đổi chiều


### RMS of U and I
![[Pasted image 20220822102940.png]]-> P = I^2R = U^2/R. 
therefore, we need average of I^2 and U^2 (not I and U) 
![[Pasted image 20220822103628.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220822103412.png]]
-> I_rms = squareroot of mean of I^2

# RLC

- resistor is the default, **in** **phase**
- [[capacitors]] push the current ahead of voltage **90 degrees** 
- **inductors** cause self-inductance (EMF a.k.a suất điện động (V) ), current behind **90 degrees**

-> cảm kháng, dung kháng: like R, $\omega$ * C or $\omega$ * L

### combo of RLC
![[Pasted image 20220828164228.png]]
-> Zl - Zc due to reverse I of capacitor & inductance 
-> use vector to prove above.
![[Pasted image 20220828165407.png]]
-> above divided by i, derive this

### power 
![[Pasted image 20220828164328.png]]
-> U*cos$\omega$ puts U same axis with I. 
-> still use vector above to prove, Z is sum impedences. 



capacitors in a series has the same Q
