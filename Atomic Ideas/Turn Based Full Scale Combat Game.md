# Question 
1. Do you have any assets (sprites, music)? If not i will use random sprites, is that ok?
2. Most of the UI, menu i make will be basic, and focus on functionality, is that ok for you?
3. Do you want me to make the Enemy, boss and theirs A.I?
4. Can you clarify: a dialouge system which link mission together? Do you mean the conversations create a storyline for all missions?
