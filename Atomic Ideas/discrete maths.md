```
1. PART 1 
2. cartesian product, cardinality is size of set |power set| = 2^n, n is cardinality of original set reason: for every element we can add it to a subset or not => 2 options ordered pair demorgan 2. PART 2 symmetric diff: xor (A/B) U (B/A) indexed (sigma version of sets) well ordering principle
```
# Terms 
- Cartesian prod 
- Cardinality = size of set 
- power set of A= all subset of A
- ordered pair
- D morgan
- symmetric diff: xor (A/B) U (B/A)
- indexed = sigma version of sets
- well ordering principle
