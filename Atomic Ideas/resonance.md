# Resonance
- periodic assistive force same direction as veloc **and** 
 has same frequency as **natural frequency**
-> the assistive force at the **same pace** with the moving object 
-> adding even more **amplitude**

- In the link below, if we applied force not same pace, the amplitude is actually decrease.
