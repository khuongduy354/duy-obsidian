# Terms 
### Blockchain
- a distributed database/ledger, contains of lists (blocks) linked (chained) by hashes
-> called blockchain 
- similar to linked list, use hashes instead of pointers
[How does a blockchain work - Simply Explained - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)
### Blockchain securities: 
1. Hashes, if a block (list) changes its data, its hash is changed 
-> Invalidate the block 
2. Proof of work / Proof of stake, see Concensus below 
3. Concensus, Distributed: when someone joins blockchain network, get full copy of blockchain
-> only if all copy synced, the blockchains get validated
### Smart  contracts
code stored on blockchain, when conditions are met, run the code and execute coin exchanges. 
-> like auto coke machines
- where it is stored: [Where does the smart contracts stored and executed on blockchain | Edureka Community](https://www.edureka.co/community/2641/where-does-smart-contracts-stored-and-executed-blockchain)

# Concensus 
### Proof of work (mining)
- verify by solving hash problem 
- earn rewards (in coin) after done 
-> new coins minted through reward
[PoW](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-mining)
### Proof of state (minting)
- verify by choosing one with high stakes 
- take their stakes 
- if they do bad things to transaction -> takes all stakes.
[PoS](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-proof-of-work-or-proof-of-stake)
# Problems 
### double spending 
- 2 transaction at same time, in a distributed system, dont know which will come first -> PoW, PoS above 
### 51 attack 
- in mining, PoW, if someone gets 51% computing powers, they will most likely to chose to validate 
- in minting, PoS, if someone gets 51% crypto, they will most likely to be chose to validate
