# Questions
- What is electronic identity account (is it Vneid) ? 
- Which banks allow to transfer money in another country (internationally)?   
-> UOB has limited to only 3 countries.
-> Stated below, they use passport
- "In-app facial recognition implementation for payment authentication", is this a technical problem or lack of data problem  
- What is biometrics compared to ?? If not government  (see rules)



# Problem space 
## Rules: 
Large amount transactions requires: 
1. biometric match ID card ( by government ) 
2. electronic identity account (i think it's password, mail,...) created by authentication identification and authentication system 
3. biometric match biometric database (maybe database in government)


First time use requires:   
1. biometric match ID card ( by government ) 
2. customerâ€™s electronic identity account established by
the electronic identification and authentication system (same as above, this maybe password,...) 
3. Biometric match biometric database (database collected elsewhere, maybe government) + OTP 

Alert other devices (subscribed consumers) when log 1st time 
Store min of 3 months transactions history 

## Business 
NFC + biometric solves most things 

problems for foreigners:  
- Passport verification (cross-border payment)   
- In-app facial recognition implementation for payment authentication (I think the problem is lacking database)  

-> Foreigners mostly use passport, but there's a lack of data for biometric

+ Balance sheet lending

+ Debt-based securities
- through investing (equity based) 

- through donation (for free)

- through reward (receive product/gifts,... instead of cash/equity)

-> Pain points: Despite faster, cheaper, more scalable, but Customer Fouls, regulations,... 

A large portion of Funding is debt-based
