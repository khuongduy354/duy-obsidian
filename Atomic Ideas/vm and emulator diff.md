This definition is related with the concept of virtual machines (VM) like Java and others. A virtual machine is any kind of computer which does not exists as a real hardware but it is implemented by software over a real computer. A virtual machine has many uses like providing code portability or hiding specific hardware characteristics to the software (for example the OS provides a virtual machine to the user programs). And of course a virtual machine can be implemented to emulate another computer over
our computer. So an emulator can be viewed as a virtual machine.
