# Omega in SMH

-> $\omega$t gives the **angle of circle**, which synonymus to **x-axis value** in the oscillation
-> the answer to this **intuition** is that, they're just probably **similar**


- Omega dictates the rate of cycling, also the frequency of oscillation
-> the **bigger** $\omega$ the **faster** oscillation, the more **squeezed** in graph

- reversely, **smaller** $\omega$, **looser** graph
![[Omega in SMH 2022-07-19 14.48.51.excalidraw]]
- $\omega$ controls the rate of movement of  **t** in **x-axis**  


- Also good explain
