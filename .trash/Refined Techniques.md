# Concept before App 2 blackboxing
### wide 
- everything boils down to a concept, learn it 1st 
- mass producing practice (use cheatsheet for e.g)
### black boxing: if above concept is too hard 
- know what it does 
- apply it 
- learn how it does that 
# creative: solving hard problems, need creativity
### very hard 
- think hard, think loose, stop thinking, repeat
- alternate beween thing and not thinking 
- quickly implement it after done thinking 
# MVP
### fast 
- aims for 80% of things
- when done, aim for the next 80% 

## Strategy 
- To decide what to do **be creative**
- To do things, aim for **MVP**
- **Concepts over App** first, if concept is hard to grasp, then **blackboxing**: know what it does 


**Notes**: In my workflow with physics, I should **black boxing** to skip more and do things faster 
- piano, gym are good to apply **eat frog**. Also maths
