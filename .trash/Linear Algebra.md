### Linear Independent

> add vectors add more dimensions

### Linear Dependent

> add vectors doesn’t change the vector space

→ e.g: 2 vectors make a space, add a vector on that space, no matter how large it is, doesnt add a dimension to the space

### Vector space

> a collection of independent vectors that span the full space
